# Miscellaneous notes about tools

Unfortunately I've found that because I don't actually blow
up and rebuild my dev machine on a weekly basis, it becomes very
challenging for me to always keep my setup scripts and dotconfar
up to date. This is further compounded by the fact that I can't
actually use identical setups on all machines; in particular
devservers at work (linux machines configured in a corporate
datacenter context) and my laptop can mostly but not entirely
overlap.

As a result, I need a dumping ground for notes on setup and
configuration that isn't ready for including in my dotconfar,
so that I don't constantly forget how I got my machine working
(a repeatable, exactuable script >> notes, but notes >> nothing
but a vague memory!).

This directory is for such notes.
